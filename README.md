# UnityFPSScripts
FPS scripts that I've been working on.

Feel free to use in your projects!
# USE REQUIRMENTS
You must credit me (you can just use PugHut)
(optional) Email me a link to your game I would love to check it out! (PugHutStudios@gmail.com)

# LIMITS
As of 7/4/2023 the scripts only have:
Shooting
A shoot Point (Where the bullet spawns out of)
Audio (For shooting)
Animations (Shooting, Reloading, and Aiming)
Weapon sway does not work with an animator (So its useless)
Reloading and Aiming animations don't currently work

# THE FUTURE OF THIS
Later I may add a player controller like Quake III or ULTRAKILL
(Unlikely) I used ChatGPT to help me with the scripts (I can barely code) so I may rewrite them.
